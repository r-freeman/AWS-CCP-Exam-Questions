DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-region replication, in-memory caching, and data export tools.</p>\n\n<p>DynamoDB global tables replicate data automatically across your choice of AWS Regions and automatically scale capacity to accommodate your workloads. With global tables, your globally distributed applications can access data locally in the selected regions to get single-digit millisecond read and write performance. DynamoDB offers active-active cross-region support that is needed for the company.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Accelerator</strong> - DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is an in-memory cache that delivers fast read performance for your tables at scale by enabling you to use a fully managed in-memory cache. Using DAX, you can improve the read performance of your DynamoDB tables by up to 10 times—taking the time required for reads from milliseconds to microseconds, even at millions of requests per second. DAX does not offer active-active cross-Region configuration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Aurora with multi-master cluster</strong> - Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications. In a multi-master cluster, all DB instances have read/write capability. Currently, all DB instances in a multi-master cluster must be in the same AWS Region. You can't enable cross-Region replicas from multi-master clusters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MYSQL</strong> - Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.

Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances cannot be interrupted. So this is the correct option.</p>\n\n<p>EC2 Pricing Options Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt1-q8-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>On-Demand Instance</strong> - An On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as Reserved instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spot Instance</strong> - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time. So this option is not correct for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not cost-efficient compared to On-Demand instances. So this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n",

This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of software. To configure weighted routing, you create records that have the same name and type for each of your resources. You assign each record a relative weight that corresponds with how much traffic you want to send to each resource.

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure the database in RDS Multi-AZ deployment with automatic failover to the standby</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deploy the database via Elastic Beanstalk</strong> - You cannot deploy only a database via Elastic Beanstalk as its meant for automatic application deployment when you upload your code. Then Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Hence this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure the database in RDS read replica mode with automatic failover to the standby</strong> - For RDS, Read replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. There is no standby available while using read replicas. In case of infrastructure failure, you have to manually promote the read replica to be its own standalone DB Instance, which means that the database endpoint would change. Therefore, this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision the database via CloudFormation</strong> - You can provision the database via CloudFront for sure, however, it does not provide any automatic recovery in case of a disaster.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p>\n"

Horizontally scalable systems are oftentimes able to outperform vertically scalable systems by enabling parallel execution of workloads and distributing those across many different computers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fault tolerance is achieved by Horizontal scaling</strong> - Horizontal scaling adds more instances to its existing pool to scale.

Over-provisioning resources can lead to unnecessary infrastructure costs, and under-provisioning resources can lead to poor application performance. Compute Optimizer helps you choose optimal configurations for three types of AWS resources: Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and AWS Lambda functions, based on your utilization data.</p>\n\n<p>Compute Optimizer recommends up to 3 options from 140+ EC2 instance types, as well as a wide range of EBS volume and Lambda function configuration options, to right-size your workloads.

You can also group resources by application, view operational data for monitoring and troubleshooting, implement pre-approved change workflows, and audit operational changes for your groups of resources. Systems Manager simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easier to operate and manage your infrastructure at scale. Systems Manager cannot be used to identify the optimal resource configuration for workloads running on AWS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Budgets</strong> - AWS Budgets allows you to set custom budgets to track your cost and usage from the simplest to the most complex use cases. With AWS Budgets, you can choose to be alerted by email or SNS notification when actual or forecasted cost and usage exceed your budget threshold, or when your actual RI and Savings Plans' utilization or coverage drops below your desired threshold. With AWS Budget Actions, you can also configure specific actions to respond to cost and usage status in your accounts, so that if your cost or usage exceeds or is forecasted to exceed your threshold, actions can be executed automatically or with your approval to reduce unintentional over-spending.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Cost Explorer</strong> - AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. Cost Explorer Resource Rightsizing Recommendations and Compute Optimizer use the same recommendation engine. The Compute Optimizer recommendation engine delivers recommendations to help customers identify optimal EC2 instance types for their workloads. The Cost Explorer console and API surface a subset of these recommendations that may lead to cost savings, and augments them with customer-specific cost and savings information (e.g. billing information, available credits, RI, and Savings Plans) to help Cost Management owners quickly identify savings opportunities through infrastructure rightsizing. Compute Optimizer console and its API delivers all recommendations regardless of the cost implications.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/\">https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/</a></p>\n"

You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK). Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID and a secret access key. As a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests.\nWhen you create an access key pair, save the access key ID and secret access key in a secure location. The secret access key is available only at the time you create it. If you lose your secret access key, you must delete the access key and create a new one.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a new IAM user and share the username and password</strong> - This is not a viable option, IAM user credentials are not needed to access resources programmatically.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Multi Factor Authentication to access AWS resources programmatically</strong> - For increased security, AWS recommends that you configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) to help protect your AWS resources. You can enable MFA for IAM users or the AWS account root user. MFA adds extra security because it requires users to provide unique authentication from an AWS supported MFA mechanism in addition to their regular sign-in credentials when they access AWS websites or services. MFA cannot be used for programmatic access to AWS resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use IAM Groups to access AWS resources programmatically</strong> - An IAM Group is a collection of IAM users. Groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. IAM Group is for managing users and not for programmatic access to AWS resources.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html</a></p>\n"

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable client-side encryption using AWS encryption SDK</strong></p>\n\n<p>The act of encrypting data before sending it to Amazon S3 is termed as client-side encryption. The AWS encryption SDK is a client-side encryption library that is separate from the language–specific SDKs. You can use this encryption library to more easily implement encryption best practices in Amazon S3. Unlike the Amazon S3 encryption clients in the language–specific AWS SDKs, the AWS encryption SDK is not tied to Amazon S3 and can be used to encrypt or decrypt data to be stored anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable server-side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)</strong> - When you use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a root key that it regularly rotates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable server-side encryption with KMS keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)</strong> - server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) is similar to SSE-S3, but with some additional benefits and charges for using this service. There are separate permissions for the use of a KMS key that provides added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in Amazon S3. SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that shows when your KMS key was used and by whom.</p>\n\n<p>server-side encryption is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it. Amazon S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. Hence, server-side encryption is not the right answer for the current scenario. So both these options are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Encryption is enabled by default for all the objects written to Amazon S3. Additional configuration is not required</strong> - This statement is incorrect as encryption is not enabled by default on S3. You can protect data in transit using Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) or client-side encryption. Data at rest on Amazon S3 can be encrypted using server-side encryption or client-side encryption.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingClientSideEncryption.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html</a></p>\n",

You can use Elastic Load Balancing to manage incoming requests by optimally routing traffic so that no one instance is overwhelmed. Your load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your application. When an instance is added, it needs to register with the load balancer or no traffic is routed to it. When an instance is removed, it must deregister from the load balancer or traffic continues to be routed to it.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</strong> - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed in a variety of programming languages.

Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, secure, and run Elasticsearch cost effectively at scale. It is a search and analytics service from Amazon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Auto Scaling</strong> - AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. This is a scaling service that helps you spin up resources as and when you need them and scale down when the high demand reduces. Auto Scaling can be used with Elastic Load Balacing to build high performance applications.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/</a></p>\n"
