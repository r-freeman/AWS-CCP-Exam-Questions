CloudFront makes your website files (such as HTML, images, and video) available from data centers around the world (called edge locations). When a visitor requests a file from your website, CloudFront automatically redirects the request to a copy of the file at the nearest edge location. This results in faster download times than if the visitor had requested the content from a data center that is located farther away.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use CloudFormation to improve the performance of your website</strong> - AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. CloudFormation cannot be used to improve the performance of a static website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use WAF to improve the performance of your website</strong> - By using AWS WAF, you can configure web access control lists (Web ACLs) on your CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers to filter and block requests based on request signatures. Besides, by using AWS WAF's rate-based rules, you can automatically block the IP addresses of bad actors when requests matching a rule exceed a threshold that you define. WAF cannot be used to improve the performance of a static website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use S3 Transfer Acceleration to improve the performance of your website</strong> - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

You can receive reports that break down your costs by the hour or month, by product or product resource, or by tags that you define yourself. Cost and Usage Reports cannot be used to identify under-utilized EC2 instances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> - Amazon CloudWatch can be used to create alarm to monitor your estimated charges. When you enable the monitoring of estimated charges for your AWS account, the estimated charges are calculated and sent several times daily to CloudWatch as metric data. You can choose to receive alerts by email when charges have exceeded a certain threshold. Think resource performance monitoring, events, and alerts; think CloudWatch. CloudWatch cannot be used to identify under-utilized EC2 instances without manually configuring an alarm with the appropriate threshold to track the EC2 utilization, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Budgets</strong> - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others. AWS Budgets cannot be used to identify under-utilized EC2 instances without manually configuring coverage targets, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/#Cost_Optimization\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/#Cost_Optimization</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ce-rightsizing.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ce-rightsizing.html</a></p>\n",

Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of VPC endpoints: interface endpoints and gateway endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses.</p>\n\n<p>A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. The following AWS services are supported:</p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3</p>\n\n<p>DynamoDB</p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>You may see a question around this concept in the exam. Just remember that only S3 and DynamoDB support VPC Endpoint Gateway. All other services that support VPC Endpoints use a VPC Endpoint Interface.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong> - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC. This private connection takes at least one month for completion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Transit Gateway</strong> - AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as a cloud router â€“ each new connection is only made once. This service is helpful in reducing the complex topology of VPC peering when a lot of systems are involved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> - Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

You can enable access to your remote network from your VPC by creating an AWS Site-to-Site VPN (Site-to-Site VPN) connection, and configuring routing to pass traffic through the connection. VPN aids regular connectivity of AWS and your private om-premises network, it is not a data migration solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong> - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.

You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.</p>\n\n<p>Versioning-enabled buckets enable you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.

With S3 Lifecycle configuration rules, you can tell Amazon S3 to transition objects to less expensive storage classes, or archive or delete them. Lifecycle configuration will do the hard lifting of moving your data into cost-effective storage classes without user intervention. Lifecycle configuration is not meant to protect from accidental deletion of data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>S3 Storage Classes</strong> - Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases. These include S3 Standard for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data; S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown or changing access patterns; S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) for long-lived, but less frequently accessed data; and Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) for long-term archive and digital preservation.

Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agility</strong> - Agility refers to the ability of the cloud to give you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them â€“ from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elasticity</strong> - With cloud computing elasticity, you donâ€™t have to over-provision resources upfront to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the number of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost savings</strong> - The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability to deploy globally in minutes</strong> - With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.</p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>Please review the benefits of Cloud Computing:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt3-q51-i1.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt3-q51-i2.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/</a></p>\n",

There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance</strong> - Reserved Instances provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not cost-efficient compared to spot instances.

AWS Cost Explorer cannot provide a detailed report of your AWS costs by the hour into an S3 bucket.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Budgets</strong> - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others.

AWS Budgets cannot provide a detailed break down of your AWS costs by the hour.</p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>Please review the differences between \"AWS Cost and Usage Reports\" and \"AWS Cost Explorer\". Think of \"AWS Cost and Usage Reports\" as a cost management tool providing the most detailed cost and usage data for your AWS account.

GuardDuty analyzes billions of events across your AWS accounts from AWS CloudTrail (AWS user and API activity in your accounts), Amazon VPC Flow Logs (network traffic data), and DNS Logs (name query patterns).\nSecurity findings are retained and made available through the Amazon GuardDuty console and APIs for 90-days. After 90-days, the findings are discarded. To retain findings for longer than 90-days, you can enable AWS CloudWatch Events to automatically push findings to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account or another data store for long-term retention.</p>\n\n<p>How GuardDuty Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/Products/product-name/diagrams/product-page-diagram-Amazon-GuardDuty_how-it-works.4370200b49eddc34d3a55c52c584484ceb2d532b.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/\">https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>CloudTrail</strong> - AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account.
