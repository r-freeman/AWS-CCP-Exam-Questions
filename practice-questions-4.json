AWS Shield Standard is enabled for all AWS customers at no additional cost. AWS Shield Standard automatically protects your web applications running on AWS against the most common, frequently occurring DDoS attacks. You can get the full benefits of AWS Shield Standard by following the best practices of DDoS resiliency on AWS. As Shield Standard is automatically activated for all AWS customers with no options for any customizations, therefore AWS needs to manage the maintenance and configurations for this service. Hence this service falls under the purview of AWS.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong> - AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon CloudFront or an Application Load Balancer. AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. AWS WAF has to be enabled by the customer and comes under the customer's responsibility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Shield Advanced</strong> - For higher levels of protection against attacks, you can subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. As an AWS Shield Advanced customer, you can contact a 24x7 DDoS response team (DRT) for assistance during a DDoS attack. You also have exclusive access to advanced, real-time metrics and reports for extensive visibility into attacks on your AWS resources. Customers need to subscribe to Shield Advanced and need to pay for this service. It falls under customer responsibility per the AWS Shared Responsibility Model.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Security Groups for Amazon EC2</strong> - A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for the EC2 instance to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. Security groups are the responsibility of the customer.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/\">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/</a></p>\n",

Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks.

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention. Think of multi-AZ as enhancing the availability and reliability of your system, however, by itself, multi-AZ cannot be used for disaster recovery.</p>\n\n<p>How Multi-AZ Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/asset-repository/multi-az-deployments.bda9d7bf45a74103d0331a985baf2c5fb838a0fa.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p>\n\n<p>To understand the RDS disaster recovery capabilities in more detail, you can refer to this excellent AWS blog:\n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use Read Replicas for improved read performance and Multi-AZ for Disaster Recovery</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use both Read Replicas and Multi-AZ for improved read performance</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use Read Replicas for Disaster Recovery and Multi-AZ for improved read performance</strong></p>\n\n<p>These three options contradict the details provided earlier in the explanation, so these options are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p>\n",

You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. There is no need for a long-term purchasing commitment. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. Therefore On-Demand instances are the best fit for short-term, spiky and critical workloads.</p>\n\n<p>EC2 Pricing Options Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt4-q15-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spot Instance</strong> - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and other flexible tasks that can be interrupted. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance</strong> - Reserved Instances provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances are not the right choice for short-term workloads.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not cost-efficient compared to On-Demand instances.

This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as a cloud router – each new connection is only made once. As you expand globally, inter-Region peering connects AWS Transit Gateways using the AWS global network. Your data is automatically encrypted and never travels over the public internet.</p>\n\n<p>How Transit Gateway can simplify your network:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt4-q17-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/\">https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong></p>\n\n<p>AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>VPC Peering</strong> - A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. VPC peering is not transitive, a separate VPC peering connection has to be made between two VPCs that need to talk to each other. With growing VPCs, this gets difficult to manage.</p>\n\n<p>Transitive VPC Peering is not allowed:\n<img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/images/transitive-peering-diagram.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/invalid-peering-configurations.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/invalid-peering-configurations.html</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Internet Gateway</strong> - An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. You cannot use Internet Gateway to connect your on-premises data center with multiple VPCs within your AWS network.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Storage Gateway</strong> - AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. All data transferred between the gateway and AWS storage is encrypted using SSL (for all three types of gateways - File, Volume and Tape Gateways). You cannot use Storage Gateway to connect your on-premises data center with multiple VPCs within your AWS network.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/\">https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/</a></p>\n",

CloudFront is used for content delivery than for data uploads. CloudFront caches data and a subsequent request for a webpage will not go to the origin server, but will be served from the cache. S3 Transfer Acceleration is a better option for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong> - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC. This private connection takes at least one month for completion. You cannot use Direct Connect to optimize media uploads into S3.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Global Accelerator</strong> - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances. Similar to CloudFront it uses AWS Global network and edge locations for enhanced performance. It's an overall performance enhancer than an upload speed accelerator.

AWS Cost Explorer also supports forecasting to get a better idea of what your costs and usage may look like in the future so that you can plan.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Cost Explorer Features:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt4-q47-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/\">https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Cost and Usage Reports</strong> - The AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of cost and usage data available. You can use Cost and Usage Reports to publish your AWS billing reports to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you own. You can receive reports that break down your costs by the hour or month, by product or product resource, or by tags that you define yourself. AWS updates the report in your bucket once a day in a comma-separated value (CSV) format. AWS Cost and Usage Reports cannot forecast your AWS account cost and usage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Budgets</strong> - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others.  AWS Budgets cannot forecast your AWS account cost and usage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Pricing Calculator</strong> - AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set of instances and services. You cannot use this service to forecast your AWS account cost and usage.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/\">https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/</a></p>\n",

As a best practice, AWS suggests the use of temporary security credentials (IAM roles) instead of access keys.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Cognito</strong> - Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0. Amazon Cognito cannot be used to facilitate an Amazon EC2 Instance to access a DynamoDB table.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Key Management Service</strong> - AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. AWS KMS is a secure and resilient service that uses hardware security modules that have been validated under FIPS 140-2, or are in the process of being validated, to protect your keys. AWS KMS cannot be used to facilitate an Amazon EC2 Instance to access a DynamoDB table.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/authentication-and-access-control.html\">https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/authentication-and-access-control.html</a></p>\n",

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warm Standby strategy</strong></p>\n\n<p>When selecting your DR strategy, you must weigh the benefits of lower RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective) vs the costs of implementing and operating a strategy. The pilot light and warm standby strategies both offer a good balance of benefits and cost.</p>\n\n<p>This strategy replicates data from the primary Region to data resources in the recovery Region, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instances or Amazon DynamoDB tables. These data resources are ready to serve requests. In addition to replication, this strategy requires you to create a continuous backup in the recovery Region. This is because when \"human action\" type disasters occur, data can be deleted or corrupted, and replication will replicate the bad data. Backups are necessary to enable you to get back to the last known good state.</p>\n\n<p>The warm standby strategy deploys a functional stack, but at reduced capacity. The DR endpoint can handle requests, but cannot handle production levels of traffic. It may be more, but is always less than the full production deployment for cost savings. If the passive stack is deployed to the recovery Region at full capacity, however, then this strategy is known as “hot standby.” Because warm standby deploys a functional stack to the recovery Region, this makes it easier to test Region readiness using synthetic transactions.</p>\n\n<p>DR strategies:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt4-q56-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multi-site active-active strategy</strong> - This strategy uses AWS Regions as your active sites, creating a multi-Region active/active architecture. Generally, two Regions are used. Each Region hosts a highly available, multi-Availability Zone (AZ) workload stack. In each Region, data is replicated live between the data stores and also backed up. This protects against disasters that include data deletion or corruption since the data backup can be restored to the last known good state. Each regional stack serves production traffic effectively. But, this strategy is cost involving and should only be used for mission-critical applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pilot Light strategy</strong> - Pilot Light, like  Warm Standby strategy, replicates data from the primary Region to data resources in the recovery Region, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instances or Amazon DynamoDB tables. But, the DR Region in a pilot light strategy (unlike warm standby) cannot serve requests until additional steps are taken. A pilot light in a home furnace does not provide heat to the home. It provides a quick way to light the furnace burners that then provide heat.</p>\n\n<p>Warm standby can handle traffic at reduced levels immediately. Pilot light requires you to first deploy infrastructure and then scale out resources before the workload can handle requests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backup &amp; Restore strategy</strong> - Backup and Restore is associated with higher RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective). This results in longer downtimes and greater loss of data between when the disaster event occurs and recovery. However, backup and restore can still be the right strategy for workloads because it is the easiest and least expensive strategy to implement.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/</a></p>\n",

By default, new buckets, access points, and objects don't allow public access. However, users can modify bucket policies, access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access. S3 Block Public Access settings override these policies and permissions so that you can limit public access to these resources.</p>\n\n<p>When Amazon S3 receives a request to access a bucket or an object, it determines whether the bucket or the bucket owner's account has a block public access setting applied. If the request was made through an access point, Amazon S3 also checks for block public access settings for the access point. If there is an existing block public access setting that prohibits the requested access, Amazon S3 rejects the request.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Block Public Access Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt4-q65-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trigger a lambda function every time an object is uploaded on S3.

CloudWatch provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.
