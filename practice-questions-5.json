The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend, and grow, an organization's infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to the internal system.</p>\n\n<p>Overview of Cloud Computing Deployment Models:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt5-q4-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Public Cloud</strong> - A public cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud.

It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> - SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. AWS Rekognition is an example of a SaaS service.</p>\n\n<p><strong>On-premises</strong> - When an enterprise opts for on-premises, it needs to create, upgrade, and scale the on-premise IT infrastructure by investing in sophisticated hardware, compatible software, and robust services.

You can use this information to revise your policies. To summarize, you can identify unnecessary permissions so that you can revise your IAM policies accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>IAM credentials report</strong> - You can generate and download a credential report that lists all users in your account and the status of their various credentials, including passwords, access keys, and MFA devices. It is not used to review permissions granted to a user.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IAM policies</strong> - IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> - AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of your user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS Management Console, they will be prompted for their user name and password (the first factor—what they know), as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device (the second factor—what they have). Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources.

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Snowmobile</strong></p>\n\n<p>AWS Snowmobile is an Exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS. You can transfer up to 100PB per Snowmobile, a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck. Snowmobile makes it easy to move massive volumes of data to the cloud, including video libraries, image repositories, or even a complete data center migration. Transferring data with Snowmobile is more secure, fast and cost-effective.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Snowball Edge</strong> - Snowball Edge is an edge computing and data transfer device provided by the AWS Snowball service. It has on-board storage and compute power that provides select AWS services for use in edge locations. However, one Snowball Edge only provides up to 100 TB of capacity. Therefore, to transfer 50 PBs, AWS Snowball Edge is not the most cost-effective option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Snowball</strong> - AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS. The use of Snowball addresses common challenges with large- scale data transfers including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed Internet. However, one Snowball only provides up to 80 TB of capacity. Therefore, to transfer 50 PBs, AWS Snowball is not the most cost-effective option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Storage Gateway</strong> - AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid storage service that enables your on-premises applications to seamlessly use AWS cloud storage. You can use the service for backup and archiving, disaster recovery, cloud data processing, storage tiering, and migration. However, data transfer through AWS Storage Gateway takes longer even with great bandwidth. Moreover, to transfer 50 PBs of data, it will be more expensive than using AWS Snowmobile.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/snowmobile/\">https://aws.amazon.com/snowmobile/</a></p>\n"

Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action. It is a design principle of the Security pillar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Automatically recover from failure</strong> - By monitoring a system for key performance indicators (KPIs), you can trigger automation when a threshold is breached. This allows for automatic notification and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, it's possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur. It is a design principle of the Reliability pillar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use serverless architectures</strong> - In the cloud, serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain servers to carry out traditional compute activities. For example, storage services can act as static websites, removing the need for web servers, and event services can host your code for you. This not only removes the operational burden of managing these servers, but also can lower transactional costs because these managed services operate at cloud scale. It is a design principle of the Performance Efficiency pillar.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wa.aws.amazon.com/index.en.html\">https://wa.aws.amazon.com/index.en.html</a></p>\n",

AWS recommends that, as application complexity increases, IT systems should be designed in a way that reduces interdependencies. Therefore, a change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Security comes last</strong> - AWS allows you to improve your security in many, more simple ways.

Temporary security credentials work almost identically to the long-term access key credentials that your IAM users can use, with the following differences:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Temporary security credentials are short-term, as the name implies. They can be configured to last for anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. After the credentials expire, AWS no longer recognizes them or allows any kind of access from API requests made with them.</p></li>\n<li><p>Temporary security credentials are not stored with the user but are generated dynamically and provided to the user when requested. When (or even before) the temporary security credentials expire, the user can request new credentials, as long as the user requesting them still has permissions to do so.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Temporary security credentials are generated by AWS STS. By default, AWS STS is a global service with a single endpoint at https://sts.amazonaws.com. However, you can also choose to make AWS STS API calls to endpoints in any other supported Region.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Cognito</strong> - Amazon Cognito is a higher level of abstraction than STS. Amazon Cognito supports the same identity providers as AWS STS, and also supports unauthenticated (guest) access, and lets you migrate user data when a user signs in. Amazon Cognito also provides API operations for synchronizing user data so that it is preserved as users move between devices. Cognito helps create the user database, which is not possible with STS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)</strong> - AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) makes it easy to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications and provide users with single sign-on access to all their assigned accounts and applications from one place. With AWS SSO, you can easily manage access and user permissions to all of your accounts in AWS Organizations centrally. AWS SSO configures and maintains all the necessary permissions for your accounts automatically, without requiring any additional setup in the individual accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)</strong> - AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that control bot traffic and block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html</a></p>\n",

DataSync provides timely delivery to ensure dependent processes are not delayed. You can specify exclude filters, include filters, or both, to determine which files, folders or objects get transferred each time your task runs.</p>\n\n<p>AWS DataSync employs an AWS-designed transfer protocol—decoupled from the storage protocol—to accelerate data movement. The protocol performs optimizations on how, when, and what data is sent over the network. Network optimizations performed by DataSync include incremental transfers, in-line compression, and sparse file detection, as well as in-line data validation and encryption.</p>\n\n<p>Data Transfer between on-premises and AWS using DataSync:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt5-q34-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/\">https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Storage Gateway</strong> - AWS Storage Gateway is a set of hybrid cloud services that give you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. Customers use Storage Gateway to integrate AWS Cloud storage with existing on-site workloads so they can simplify storage management and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storage use cases. These include moving backups to the cloud, using on-premises file shares backed by cloud storage, and providing low latency access to data in AWS for on-premises applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Snowmobile</strong> - AWS Snowmobile is an Exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS. You can transfer up to 100PB per Snowmobile, a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck. Snowmobile makes it easy to move massive volumes of data to the cloud, including video libraries, image repositories, or even a complete data center migration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Snowcone</strong> - AWS Snowcone is the smallest member of the AWS Snow Family of edge computing, edge storage, and data transfer devices. Weighing in at 4.5 pounds (2.1 kg), AWS Snowcone is equipped with 8 terabytes of usable storage, while AWS Snowcone Solid State Drive (SSD) supports 14 terabytes of usable storage. Both referred to as Snowcone, the device is ruggedized, secure, and purpose-built for use outside of a traditional data center. Its small form factor makes it a perfect fit for tight spaces or where portability is a necessity and network connectivity is unreliable. You can use Snowcone in backpacks on first responders, or for IoT, vehicular, and drone use cases. You can execute compute applications at the edge, and you can ship the device with data to AWS for offline data transfer, or you can transfer data online with AWS DataSync from edge locations.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/\">https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/features/\">https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/features/</a></p>\n",

AWS SSO allows you to create and manage user identities in AWS SSO’s identity store, or easily connect to your existing identity source including Microsoft Active Directory, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and Okta Universal Directory.</p>\n\n<p>You can use AWS SSO to quickly and easily assign and manage your employees’ access to multiple AWS accounts, SAML-enabled cloud applications (such as Salesforce, Office 365, and Box), and custom-built in-house applications, all from a central place.</p>\n\n<p>How AWS SSO works:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt5-q61-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/\">https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Cognito</strong> - Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. With Amazon Cognito, you also have the option to authenticate users through social identity providers such as Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon, with SAML identity solutions, or by using your own identity system. It is an identity management solution for customers/developers building B2C or B2B apps for their customers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</strong> - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. It is not used to log in but to manage users and roles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong> - The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services.

Each tag is a label consisting of a user-defined key and value. Tags can help you manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources. You can create tags to categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, you use business tags such as cost center/business unit, customer, or project to associate AWS costs with traditional cost-allocation dimensions. But a cost allocation report can include any tag. This lets you associate costs with technical or security dimensions, such as specific applications, environments, or compliance programs.</p>\n\n<p>Example of tagging for cost optimization:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt5-q62-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create different accounts for different departments</strong> - Users can belong to several departments.

Also, it is much simpler to set up tags for tracking costs for each department.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create one account for all departments and share this account</strong> - Sharing accounts is not a security best practice, and is not recommended.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create different VPCs for different departments</strong> - Creating different VPCs will not help with separating costs.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html</a></p>\n"
