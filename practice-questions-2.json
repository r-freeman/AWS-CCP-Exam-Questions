        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:\n<strong>Amazon Rekognition</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cloud Computing can be broadly divided into three types - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS).</p>\n\n<p>IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. <strong>Examples - Amazon EC2 (on AWS), GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode.</strong></p>\n\n<p>PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. You don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. <strong>Examples - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS), Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft).</strong></p>\n\n<p>SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. <strong>Examples - Amazon Rekognition, Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Overview of Cloud Computing Types:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt2-q1-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/</a></p>\n\n<p>You can use Amazon Rekognition to add image and video analysis to your applications using proven, highly scalable, deep learning technology that requires no machine learning expertise. With Amazon Rekognition, you can identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos as well as detect any inappropriate content. Rekognition is an example of Software as a Service model.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon EC2</strong> - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Hence, it comes under Infrastructure as a Service type of Cloud Computing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</strong> - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. You simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Per the definitions above, Elastic Beanstalk falls under the Platform as a Service type.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elastic Load Balancing</strong> - Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. This has been added as a distractor.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/\">https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/</a></p>\n",

Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. IAM enables security best practices by allowing you to grant unique security credentials to users and groups to specify which AWS service APIs and resources they can access. These features make IAM an important service for the overall security of AWS resources in your account. IAM is secure by default; users have no access to AWS resources until permissions are explicitly granted.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers.

This is in contrast to a \"vertically scalable\" system, which is constrained to running its processes on only one computer; in such systems, the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, memory or storage. Horizontally scalable systems are oftentimes able to outperform vertically scalable systems by enabling parallel execution of workloads and distributing those across many different computers.</p>\n\n<p>Elastic Load Balancing - Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.

S3 Standard-IA matches the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. S3 One Zone-IA costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use S3 Standard to store the thumbnails</strong> - S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data. As described above, S3 One Zone-IA is a better fit than S3 Standard, hence using S3 standard is ruled out for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use S3 Glacier to store the thumbnails</strong> - S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving.

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>On-Demand Instances</strong> - An On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted.</p>\n\n<p>EC2 Pricing Options Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt2-q31-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instances</strong> - Reserved Instances provide you with significant savings on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. You will be charged for the entire duration, irrespective of your usage, so this option is not correct for running weekly workloads. So this option is not correct for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spot Instances</strong> - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time. So this option is not correct for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Hosts</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not cost-efficient compared to On-Demand instances. So this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n",

These conditions include IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, URI strings, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting. You can use the IP address based match rule to block specific geographies. The accuracy of the IP Address to country lookup database varies by Region. Based on recent tests, AWS mentions that the overall accuracy for the IP address to country mapping is 99.8%.</p>\n\n<p>How WAF Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/products/WAF/product-page-diagram_AWS-WAF_How-it-Works@2x.452efa12b06cb5c87f07550286a771e20ca430b9.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/waf/\">https://aws.amazon.com/waf/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Route 53</strong></p>\n\n<p>Route 53 is Amazon's Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 geolocation routing policy to block certain geographies.

It works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications. Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.\nFargate allocates the right amount of compute, eliminating the need to choose instances and scale cluster capacity. You only pay for the resources required to run your containers, so there is no over-provisioning and paying for additional servers. Fargate runs each task or pod in its kernel providing the tasks and pods their own isolated compute environment. This enables your application to have workload isolation and improved security by design.</p>\n\n<p>How Fargate Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/re19/FargateonEKS/Product-Page-Diagram_Fargate@2x.a20fb2b15c2aebeda3a44dbbb0b10b82fb89aa6a.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Container Service - EC2 launch type</strong> - Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. Unlike Fargate, this is not a fully managed service and you need to manage the underlying servers yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> - AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.

A broad range of workloads, such as relational and non-relational databases, enterprise applications, containerized applications, big data analytics engines, file systems, and media workflows are widely deployed on Amazon EBS. An EBS can only be mounted to one EC2 instance at a time, so this option is not correct for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EC2 Instance Store</strong> - An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your EC2 instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. Instance storage is temporary, data is lost if instance experiences failure or is terminated. EC2 instance store cannot be used for file sharing between instances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3</strong> - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.

The A2A pub/sub functionality provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. Amazon SNS allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a “push” mechanism, which implies that the receiving applications have to be present and running to receive the messages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis data stream</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams enables you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming data for specialized needs. You can continuously add various types of data such as clickstreams, application logs, and social media to an Amazon Kinesis data stream from hundreds of thousands of sources. Within seconds, the data will be available for your Amazon Kinesis Applications to read and process from the stream.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/faqs/</a></p>\n",

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong> - Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open source tools such as Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto. Amazon EMR can be used to provision resources to run big data workloads on Hadoop clusters.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Step Function</strong> - AWS Step Function lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. You can design and run workflows that stitch together services such as AWS Lambda, AWS Glue and Amazon SageMaker.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Step Functions Overview:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Step%20Functions/sfn_how-it-works.f795601e8338db32506b9abb01e71704f483fc81.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/\">https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Batch</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can use AWS Batch to plan, schedule and execute your batch computing workloads across the full range of AWS compute services. AWS Batch dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory optimized instances) based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted. AWS Batch provisions compute resources and optimizes the job distribution based on the volume and resource requirements of the submitted batch jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Please review the common use-cases for AWS Batch:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt2-q64-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/batch/\">https://aws.amazon.com/batch/</a></p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>Understand the difference between AWS Step Functions and AWS Batch. You may get questions to choose one over the other. AWS Batch runs batch computing workloads by provisioning the compute resources. AWS Step Function does not provision any resources. Step Function only orchestrates AWS services required for a given workflow. You cannot use Step Functions to plan, schedule and execute your batch computing workloads by provisioning underlying resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon EC2</strong> - Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. You can use EC2 to provision virtual servers on AWS Cloud. You cannot use EC2 to plan, schedule and execute your batch computing workloads by provisioning underlying resources.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/emr/\">https://aws.amazon.com/emr/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/batch/\">https://aws.amazon.com/batch/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/\">https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/</a></p>\n",
